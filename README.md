# PilotCity-Discord-Integration-Module

This is a work-in-progress, I do intend to finish this and contine expanding it. The Discord part is written in Python so it can be easily integrated with the existing bot. The frontend is done wrong according to Dereck, I did the tab structure incorrectly and am currently working on fixing it. In the Discord folder, please ignore api.py as it doesn't work at all and is about to be replaced. Sill waiting for an actual Mongo database to interact with.

INTENDED FEATURES (to be added later):
    - Connect PilotCity Student IDs with Discord IDs
    - Notification system through Discord (could come directly from employers)
    - Automatic team-chat creation and management in the PilotCity Discord
        - Automatic Github notifications with webhooks
        - Meeting coordination
        - Requests for advice (to PilotCity team)
        - Integration with future chat app on the platform
    - Event coordination
    - Possibly more to come later
